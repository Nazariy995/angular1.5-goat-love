This is a project started from the [NG6-Starter repository](https://github.com/bivainis/NG6-starter-sass)
It is also a follow up of the following project from this tutorial: [Angular 1.5 Components](http://blog.grossman.io/angular-1-component-based-architecture-2/)

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
Tools needed to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`
Once you have these, install the following as globals:  
`npm install -g gulp karma karma-cli webpack`

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install -g gulp karma karma-cli webpack` install global cli dependencies
* `npm install` to install dependencies

## Running the App
NG6 uses Gulp to build and launch the development environment. After you have installed all dependencies, you may run the app. Running `gulp` will bundle the app with `webpack`, launch a development server, and watch all files. The port will be displayed in the terminal.
